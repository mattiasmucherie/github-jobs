      "<h2>Company Description</h2>\n<p>At CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, physicists and engineers are probing the fundamental structure of the universe. Using the world's largest and most complex scientific instruments, they study the basic constituents of matter - fundamental particles that are made to collide together at close to the speed of light. The process gives physicists clues about how particles interact, and provides insights into the fundamental laws of nature. Find out more on <a href=\"http://home.cern\">http://home.cern</a>.</p>\n<h2>Job Description</h2>\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>Are you an experienced and motivated Java developer with a passion for delivering complex and compelling information systems end-to-end?
